<h1 align="center"> üçú Introduction </h1>

## Danny's Diner is a newly opened restaurant that specializes in Japanese cuisine, sushi, curry, and ramen.
## In the early months of 2021, Danny decides to start his venture to fulfill his love for Japanese food.

## However, the restaurant is struggling to stay afloat, and Danny realizes that he needs to leverage the data collected from his business to make better-informed decisions.

<br />

## The primary objective of this data analysis project is to answer several questions about the customers visiting patterns, the amount of money they've spent, and their favorite menu items.

## This information will help Danny deliver a more personalized experience to his loyal customers, thereby increasing customer retention and loyalty.
